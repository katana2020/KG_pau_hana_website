                  This Iron Chef brought the signature flavor to the States when
                  he opened up his restaurant Morimoto in Philadelphia in the
                  early 2000s and has since opened up more locations in Napa
                  Valley and New York City. He has several restaurant concepts
                  across the U.S., Canada, and Asia, further solidifying his

                  He’s cooked for the Prime Minister of the U.K., his cookbook
                  The Naked Chef is a best-seller, and in 2003 he was awarded a
                  Member of the Order of the British Empire. He’s gone on to
